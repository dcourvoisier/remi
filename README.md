# remi_smmr
This repository presents a first order return to equilibrium model following multiple inputs and it is a companion of the paper from Mongin et al. (2018). For a detailed description of the model and the functions presented on the file, please visit the wiki.

## Getting Started

Either copy the code directly from the remi_smmr.R file into a new script in RStudio or use github's download button to download the whole R file. Copy the file in your local RStudio directory and then type 
>source('remi_smmr.R')

so that R loads the file into your workspace and that you are able to use the functions inside the file.

## Prerequisites

RStudio or R are needed to run the code presented. 
Some extra libraries are needed to run the functions in remi_smmr.R. These are detailed at the beginning of the file itself and thus, when running the code through the "source()" command mentioned above, they will be automatically loaded.
